                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>💀 What are Skeletons?</h3>
                        <p>Skeletons are the reanimated skeletal remains of powerful sorcerers who have been touched by death magic in such a way that their consciousness remains bound to their bones. Unlike mindless undead, Skeletons retain their personality, memories, and magical abilities, making them unique among the undead.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most Skeletons are created when a powerful sorcerer is killed by death magic but their will to survive is so strong that their soul refuses to pass on. The death magic, instead of destroying them completely, strips away their flesh and binds their essence to their skeletal remains.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🧠 Consciousness and Personality</h3>
                        <p>Skeletons maintain their full consciousness, memories, and personality from their living days. They are not driven by hunger, bloodlust, or other base urges that affect many undead creatures. This makes them potentially valuable allies or dangerous enemies, depending on who they were in life.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, the trauma of death and undeath can affect their mental state. Some Skeletons become more detached from mortal concerns, while others develop obsessions or fixations related to their death or unfinished business.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🎭 Appearance and Form</h3>
                        <p>Skeletons appear exactly as their name suggests - animated skeletal remains with no flesh, organs, or other soft tissue. Their bones are typically bleached white, though some may show discoloration based on the circumstances of their death or the type of magic that created them.</p>
                        
                        <div class="subsection">
                            <h4>Physical Characteristics:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bone Structure:</strong> Maintains the exact skeletal structure from their living form</li>
                                <li><strong>Eye Sockets:</strong> Often glow with a faint light, color varies by individual</li>
                                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Fluid and natural, defying the normal physics of bone structure</li>
                                <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Remains largely unchanged, though may have a slight hollow quality</li>
                                <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Can wear normal clothing and accessories</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🌍 Place in the Magical World</h3>
                        <p>Skeletons occupy a unique position in magical society. While they are technically undead, their retention of consciousness and personality means they are often treated as individuals rather than monsters. However, their appearance and undead nature can make social interactions challenging.</p>
                        
                        <p>Many Skeletons work for Sanctuaries as detectives or specialists, as their undead nature makes them immune to many forms of attack and their experience makes them valuable assets. Others choose to live in isolation or pursue their own agendas.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>⚔️ Combat Capabilities</h3>
                        <p>Skeletons are formidable combatants, combining their magical abilities from life with the advantages of their undead state. They feel no pain, require no rest, and cannot be killed by conventional means, making them extremely dangerous opponents.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their lack of vital organs means that many attacks that would be lethal to living beings are merely inconvenient to Skeletons. They can continue fighting even with significant damage to their skeletal structure.</p>
