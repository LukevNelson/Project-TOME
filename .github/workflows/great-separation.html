                <h2>The Division of Worlds</h2>
                <p>The Great Separation represents the most significant event in human history - the moment when the supernatural and mundane worlds diverged into parallel but separate realities. What began as a coordinated suppression of the Knights Templar became a complete restructuring of how reality itself operates for humanity.</p>

                <div class="info-panel">
                    <h3>Core Understanding</h3>
                    <p>Before 1307, supernatural and mundane existed in the same reality. Humans regularly interacted with supernatural beings, magic was practiced openly in many regions, and the cosmic hierarchy was commonly understood. The Great Separation changed this forever.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What Actually Happened</h3>
                <p>Contrary to historical records, the suppression of the Knights Templar on October 13, 1307, was not primarily about heresy or political power. The Templars had discovered the true nature of the cosmic hierarchy and were attempting to establish humanity as a recognized power within it. Their actions threatened the carefully maintained balance that kept supernatural forces from overwhelming human civilization.</p>

                <h3>The Supernatural Response</h3>
                <p>Multiple Tier 3 and Tier 4 entities, recognizing the existential threat that empowered humanity posed, coordinated the most extensive reality manipulation in recorded history. Rather than destroy humanity, they chose separation - creating parallel dimensional layers where humans could exist in ignorance while supernatural forces operated in shadow.</p>

                <h3>Key Principles of Separation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dimensional Layering:</strong> Creation of the Supernatural Overlay dimension</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Barriers:</strong> Mental blocks preventing most humans from perceiving supernatural activity</li>
                    <li><strong>Reality Anchoring:</strong> Stabilization of mundane reality against supernatural influence</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical Revision:</strong> Mass alteration of human records and memories</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Jerusalem Excavation (1119-1127)</h3>
                <p>The true purpose of the Knights Templar's presence at the Temple Mount was not protecting pilgrims, but conducting archaeological excavations. In 1127, they discovered a chamber containing Primordial artifacts and texts that revealed the true nature of reality's hierarchical structure.</p>

                <div class="discovery-details">
                    <h4>What They Found</h4>

                <h3>The Templar Plan (1127-1307)</h3>
                <p>Armed with this knowledge, the Templars spent 180 years developing a comprehensive strategy to elevate humanity's position in the cosmic hierarchy. Their plan was ambitious and ultimately threatening to established supernatural powers:</p>

                <div class="plan-phase">
                    <h4>Phase 1: Knowledge Consolidation (1127-1200)</h4>
                    <p>The Templars used their discoveries to understand supernatural forces and establish contact with various entities. They learned to use binding protocols and began accumulating power through strategic alliances and careful manipulation of supernatural politics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="plan-phase">
                    <h4>Phase 2: Network Expansion (1200-1270)</h4>
                    <p>The Order expanded across Europe, establishing chapters that served dual purposes as both military outposts and research facilities. They began recruiting individuals with supernatural abilities and developed the first human-led organizations capable of challenging Tier 5 entities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="plan-phase">
                    <h4>Phase 3: The Ascension Attempt (1270-1307)</h4>
                    <p>The Templars' final phase involved attempting to collectively ascend humanity to Tier 6 status within the cosmic hierarchy. They planned to use a massive ritual powered by accumulated artifacts and the faith of their members to fundamentally alter humanity's relationship to reality.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Supernatural Coalition</h3>
                <p>By 1300, supernatural powers had recognized the existential threat the Templars represented. A unprecedented coalition formed between entities that had been enemies for millennia:</p>

                <div class="coalition-member">
                    <h4>The Original Family</h4>
                    <p>Led the vampire response, fearing that human ascension would challenge their authority over their turned children. Mikael personally coordinated with other Tier 3 entities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coalition-member">
                    <h4>The Fae Courts</h4>
                    <p>Both Summer and Winter Courts set aside their eternal conflict to prevent human elevation, which would have disrupted the careful balance of seasonal magic.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coalition-member">
                    <h4>Elder Dragons</h4>
                    <p>The remaining Elder Dragons emerged from centuries of isolation to participate, recognizing that human ascension could lead to challenges against their regional domains.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="coalition-member">
                    <h4>Demonic Hierarchies</h4>
                    <p>Even the usually fractious demon lords coordinated their efforts, understanding that human empowerment would make soul collection and corruption significantly more difficult.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="warning-panel">
                    <h3>⚠️ The Point of No Return</h3>
                    <p>By October 1307, the Templars had begun their ascension ritual. The supernatural coalition had mere days to act before the ritual's completion would have fundamentally altered reality. What followed was not just the destruction of an organization, but the restructuring of existence itself.</p>

                <div class="warning-panel">
                    <h3>⚠️ The Technology Problem</h3>
                    <p>The supernatural coalition's encouragement of scientific development has backfired. Modern human technology can now detect and affect supernatural entities in ways that threaten the separation itself. This is driving current supernatural politics and may force a new Great Working.</p>
