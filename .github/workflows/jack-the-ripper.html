                        <h3>🗡️ The Historical Deception</h3>
                        <p>What historians recorded as the work of a serial killer was, in truth, something far more sinister. Jack the Ripper was no mere mortal madman, but one of the Original Family - the Sibling of Decay - conducting a twisted experiment in viral transmutation and biological warfare.</p>
                        <p>The 1864 London murders were not random acts of violence, but carefully orchestrated tests of an evolved supernatural pathogen that could transform the very nature of death itself.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🦠 A Living Weapon</h3>
                        <p>The Sibling of Decay had infected himself with an evolved strain of what mortals would later call the "Ripper Virus" - a supernatural pathogen that combined vampire-like blood hunger with necromantic animation properties. This made him a walking biological weapon, spreading corruption through both direct contact and emotional manipulation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🧠 Feeding on Psychology</h3>
                        <p>Unlike conventional vampires who feed on blood, Jack fed on guilt, shame, and memory. He could sense these emotions from great distances and was drawn to individuals carrying heavy psychological burdens. This made Victorian London, with its rigid moral codes and hidden sins, the perfect hunting ground.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>⚠️ The Ripper Warning</h3>
                        <p>The name "Ripper" was not chosen randomly by the killer himself, but was a <strong>warning</strong> left by those who knew his true nature. Certain members of the supernatural community recognized what he was and spread coded warnings through London's underground networks, hoping to protect the innocent.</p>

                        <h3>💀 The Sibling of Decay</h3>
                        <p>Among the Original Family, the Sibling of Decay was always the most troubled. Where his siblings created species and fostered growth, he was drawn to corruption, disease, and the breakdown of natural order. His domain was entropy itself - the force that causes all things to eventually crumble and rot.</p>

                        <p>The Sibling of Decay chose 1864 London for specific reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Industrial Pollution:</strong> The city's contaminated air and water provided ideal conditions for viral experimentation</li>
                            <li><strong>Social Repression:</strong> Victorian moral strictures created abundant guilt and shame to feed upon</li>
                            <li><strong>Population Density:</strong> Millions of potential hosts in close proximity</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Medicine:</strong> Primitive medical understanding made supernatural diseases difficult to detect</li>
                            <li><strong>Class System:</strong> Stark inequality created desperate victims who wouldn't be missed</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🔬 The Great Experiment</h3>
                        <p>The London murders were part of a larger experiment to perfect a supernatural pathogen that could:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preserve consciousness after death</li>
                            <li>Create controllable undead servants</li>
                            <li>Spread vampiric traits without traditional vampire weaknesses</li>
                            <li>Generate a self-sustaining epidemic of supernatural corruption</li>
                            <li>Test the limits of how much humanity could be stripped away while maintaining intelligence</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Despite its terrifying capabilities, the Ripper Virus ultimately failed to spread globally:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Creator's Instability:</strong> The Sibling of Decay was mentally unstable, making the virus unpredictable</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-Consuming:</strong> The virus eventually began consuming itself</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Host Compatibility:</strong> Most humans couldn't survive the transformation</li>
                            <li><strong>Supernatural Immunity:</strong> Other Original Family members were immune</li>
                            <li><strong>Divine Intervention:</strong> Some believe the Primordials intervened to stop it</li>

                        <p>Jack's approach to hunting was methodical and psychological rather than purely predatory. He would study potential victims for weeks, learning their routines, fears, and deepest shames before striking.</p>

                            <p>Before killing, he would often manipulate his victims' memories, forcing them to relive their worst moments. This generated fresh trauma and guilt for him to feed upon.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Viral Claws:</strong> Fingernails extended into razor-sharp, poison-coated talons</li>
                            <li><strong>Acid Saliva:</strong> Could spit corrosive substances that dissolved flesh and bone</li>

                            <li><strong>Bone Blades:</strong> Could extrude sharpened bones from his arms as cutting weapons</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood Whips:</strong> Manipulated his own infected blood into solid, flexible weapons</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Evidence Corruption:</strong> His presence corrupted physical evidence, making forensic analysis impossible</li>
                            <li><strong>Magical Interference:</strong> Generated fields that disrupted magical tracking and scrying</li>
                            <li><strong>False Memories:</strong> Implanted fake memories in witnesses</li>
                            <li><strong>Viral Distractions:</strong> Created infected animals to serve as red herrings</li>
                            <li><strong>Timeline Confusion:</strong> Sometimes left bodies that appeared to have been killed at different times</li>

                        <blockquote>
                            <em>"When guilt weighs heavy on the world's heart,<br>
                            When shame and sorrow tear souls apart,<br>
                            The Ripper shall return to feast once more,<br>
                            On the emotional wounds of war."</em>
                        </blockquote>
