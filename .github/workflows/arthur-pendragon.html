                    <h3>⚔️ True Identity</h3>
                    <p>Arthur Pendragon was not merely a legendary king - he was <strong>the Sibling of Light</strong>, a member of the Original Family created by the Primordials. His reign as King Arthur was a deliberate experiment in divine governance, testing whether immortal wisdom could create a perfect mortal society.</p>

                            <h4>☀️ Primordial Heritage</h4>
                            <p>As the Sibling of Light, Arthur embodied illumination, truth, and revelation. His divine nature allowed him to see through deception and inspire nobility in others.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-card">
                            <h4>👑 Divine Kingship</h4>
                            <p>Arthur's rule wasn't based on mortal politics but on divine right granted by his Primordial origin. His authority came from cosmic legitimacy, not earthly inheritance.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-card">
                            <h4>🌟 The Great Experiment</h4>
                            <p>Camelot was designed as a test - could divine wisdom create a utopian human society that would serve as a model for all future civilizations?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>🏛️ The Noble Experiment</h3>
                    <p>Arthur's creation of Camelot was the most ambitious attempt by any Original Family member to directly guide human society. Unlike his siblings who worked from the shadows, Arthur chose to rule openly, using his divine heritage to establish ideals that would influence Western civilization for millennia.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        "If we are to guide humanity, let us not hide in darkness but stand in the light. Let them see what they could become when divine wisdom meets mortal courage." - Arthur's coronation speech
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>⚖️ The Burden of Perfection</h3>
                    <p>Arthur's divine nature allowed him to envision a perfect society, but his experiment revealed the fundamental tension between divine ideals and mortal nature. Even with supernatural guidance, human flaws - jealousy, ambition, love, and betrayal - ultimately undermined his utopian vision.</p>

                    <h3>☀️ Divine Abilities</h3>
                    <p>As the Sibling of Light, Arthur possessed abilities that went far beyond mortal understanding. His powers weren't flashy displays of force but subtle manipulations of truth, hope, and inspiration that could transform entire societies.</p>

                            <p>Arthur could see through any deception, illusion, or hidden motive. No lie could stand before his divine perception, making him an ideal judge and leader.</p>

                            <p>Arthur could make abstract concepts like justice and honor feel tangible and achievable, turning idealistic dreams into practical goals.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>His commands carried supernatural weight. Even enemies felt compelled to acknowledge his legitimacy as a ruler.</p>

                    <h3>🌟 The Light's Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Among the Original Family, Arthur's role was unique. While his siblings represented forces of change, decay, or transformation, Arthur embodied illumination - the power to reveal truth and possibility. His experiments with human governance were attempts to show mortals their highest potential.</p>

                            <li><strong>Revelation over Concealment:</strong> Truth should be shared, not hidden</li>
                            <li><strong>Inspiration over Domination:</strong> Lead by example, not force</li>
                            <li><strong>Unity over Division:</strong> Bring people together rather than drive them apart</li>
                            <li><strong>Hope over Despair:</strong> Show what could be, not just what is</li>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>⚔️ The Burden of Godhood</h3>
                    <p>Arthur's divine nature was both his greatest strength and his ultimate tragedy. He could see the perfect society that humans were capable of achieving, but he also understood that they had to choose that path themselves. His role was to illuminate the way, not force them to walk it.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        "I can show them the light, but I cannot make them step out of the shadows. The greatest gift I can give humanity is the choice to be better than they believe possible." - Arthur's private reflections

                    <h3>🏰 The Shining City</h3>
                    <p>Camelot was more than a castle or kingdom - it was a carefully constructed social experiment designed to test whether divine wisdom could create a sustainable utopian society. Every aspect of the kingdom, from its laws to its architecture, was infused with Arthur's supernatural insight.</p>

                        <p>Camelot's design incorporated geometric principles that naturally promoted harmony and cooperation. The layout of the city, the placement of buildings, and even the decorative elements were all chosen to psychologically encourage nobility and virtue in its inhabitants.</p>

                            <p>When Arthur finally approached the stone, he didn't just pull out a sword - he freed his father's spirit from its stone prison. Uther's consciousness, preserved in the stone, recognized his son and released Excalibur willingly. The legend says only the true king could draw the sword, but the truth is that only Arthur could free his father.</p>

                    <h3>👑 The Final Confrontation</h3>
                    <p>With Excalibur restored to the Pendragon line, Arthur faced the same enemies who had destroyed his father. The confrontation with Vortigern/Mordred became a battle not just for the crown, but for the soul of Britain itself.</p>

                        <p>The final battle mirrored his father's sacrifice but with a different outcome. Arthur, now fully aware of his divine heritage and wielding Excalibur with its complete power, faced Vortigern without hesitation. Unlike Uther, Arthur felt no mercy for the corrupted ancient king.</p>

                            <p>When Excalibur struck and remained embedded in Vortigern during the final battle, the ancient king's fate was sealed. The petrification process began slowly but inevitably, as the sword stayed lodged in his body. Vortigern, preserved by dark magic for centuries, finally met his end - not through death, but through gradual transformation into lifeless stone. Morgana, witnessing this slow but inexorable fate, fled rather than risk the same destiny.</p>

                        <p>Each potential heir to the Pendragon throne had to prove their worthiness by successfully wielding Excalibur. The sword would only accept those with noble hearts and true Pendragon blood, allowing them to safely handle and wield it. However, those who proved unworthy but still managed to handle the blade would face gradual petrification if they kept it too long or attempted to keep it permanently embedded somewhere.</p>

                    <p>Uther's sacrifice wasn't just a desperate act - it was the fulfillment of the ancient promise made to the Pendragon ancestor.

                        <p>The conspirators believed that killing the sword's bonded wielder would transfer its power to them. They didn't understand that Excalibur wasn't bound to a person, but to a promise - and that promise could only be fulfilled through sacrifice and nobility, not claimed through murder and betrayal.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            "They sought to steal what could only be given, to claim what could only be earned. The sword chooses not the strongest hand, but the most noble heart. In trying to take by force what was meant to be received through grace, they proved themselves unworthy of even touching its hilt." - Merlin's reflection on the failed conspiracy

                    <h3>🌟 The Eternal Question</h3>
                    <p>After fifteen centuries, Arthur continues to ponder the central question of his existence: Can divine wisdom guide mortal choices without compromising mortal freedom? His experiment with Camelot provided one answer, but each generation of humanity offers new possibilities and new challenges.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        "I once believed I could show them perfection and they would embrace it. Now I understand that the journey toward nobility is more important than the destination. Each generation must choose for themselves whether to reach for the light. My role is not to drag them into illumination, but to ensure that the light remains visible for those who wish to see it." - Arthur's modern reflections
