                        <h2>Species Overview</h2>
                        <p>Goblins represent one of the most widespread and misunderstood species in the magical world. Often dismissed as mere nuisances or comic relief, goblins are actually complex beings with their own rich culture, varied magical abilities, and significant impact on magical society's underground economy.</p>
                        
                        <p>These small humanoid creatures have adapted remarkably well to living alongside human civilization, often inhabiting the margins and forgotten spaces of both magical and mortal communities. Their natural cunning and opportunistic nature have made them successful in numerous roles, from street informants to magical traders.</p>

                    <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
                    <p>Archaeological evidence suggests that goblins have existed alongside human civilization for at least 3,000 years, with some legends placing their origins even earlier. Unlike many magical species that retreated from human contact, goblins have consistently chosen to live in the margins of human society, adapting and evolving with changing times.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ancient texts describe goblins as "the watchers in the spaces between," suggesting they may have originally served as intermediaries between the human and magical worlds. This role as bridges between different communities remains central to goblin identity today.</p>

                        <h4>The Great Underground</h4>
                        <p>During the medieval period, as magical persecution increased, goblins pioneered the development of extensive underground networks beneath major cities. These tunnel systems served not only as goblin communities but as safe passage for persecuted magical beings.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Guild Formation</h4>
                        <p>The clan system evolved into sophisticated guilds that controlled specific trades and services. The Information Guild, Craft Guild, and Merchant Guild emerged as the three primary powers in goblin society.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Goblin Wars (1347-1348)</h4>
                        <p>A brief but intense conflict erupted between goblin clans and vampire covens over control of urban underground territories. The goblins' superior knowledge of tunnel systems and creative warfare tactics ultimately led to a negotiated settlement that established clear territorial boundaries.</p>
