                        <h2>Species Overview</h2>
                        <p>Trolls represent one of the oldest and most misunderstood magical species in existence. Far from the crude monsters of folklore, trolls are sophisticated beings with deep connections to the natural world and profound wisdom accumulated over millennia. These ancient guardians have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations while maintaining their sacred duties as protectors of specific locations and keepers of old knowledge.</p>
                        
                        <p>Standing significantly taller and more powerfully built than humans, trolls possess an imposing physical presence that has unfortunately contributed to centuries of fear and misunderstanding. Their true nature as philosophical beings deeply connected to the earth and natural cycles remains largely unknown to most of the magical community.</p>

                    <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Trolls are imposing beings standing between 8 to 12 feet in height, with proportionally broad builds that emphasize both their physical power and their connection to the earth. Their skin has a distinctive stone-like quality, ranging from granite gray to rich earthen brown, often with natural patterns that seem to reflect the geological features of their home territories.</p>

                    <h3>Reproduction and Lifecycle</h3>
                    <p>Troll reproduction is exceptionally rare and highly ritualistic, occurring perhaps once every few centuries for any individual. The process involves complex magical ceremonies that connect the prospective parents to ancient earth spirits and require the blessing of elder trolls.</p>
                    
                    <p>Troll young, called "pebbles," are born after a gestation period of nearly two years and require decades of careful nurturing before they can survive independently. The rarity of reproduction is balanced by their exceptional longevity and the intensive care invested in each offspring.</p>

                <div class="history-section">
                    <h3>Primordial Origins</h3>
                    <p>Trolls are among the oldest magical species, with origins that may predate human civilization by tens of thousands of years. Ancient legends suggest they were among the first beings to achieve consciousness and magic, emerging from the earth itself during the world's formation. Archaeological evidence supports the presence of troll-like beings at sites dating back to the last ice age.</p>
                    
                    <p>Early troll culture was closely connected to the Primordials and other cosmic entities, serving as custodians of important locations and artifacts left behind by these ancient powers. This role as cosmic guardians established the foundation for their enduring culture of protection and preservation.</p>

                <div class="history-section">
                    <h3>The Age of Giants (15,000-8,000 BCE)</h3>
                    <div class="historical-period">
                        <h4>Megalithic Builders</h4>
                        <p>During this period, trolls were responsible for many of the world's megalithic structures, including Stonehenge, Easter Island statues, and numerous other stone circles and monuments. These weren't mere religious sites but functional magical instruments designed to stabilize dimensional boundaries and channel earth energies.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The First Guardianships</h4>
                        <p>Formal guardian traditions began during this era, with trolls accepting responsibility for protecting specific locations of cosmic significance. The oldest continuous guardianships still maintained today date from this period.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Great Isolation</h4>
                        <p>As human populations expanded and began to develop their own magical traditions, trolls gradually withdrew from active interaction with other species, preferring to maintain their guardianships in relative isolation.</p>

                    <div class="historical-period">
                        <h4>Mythological Period</h4>
                        <p>Human encounters with trolls during this period gave rise to many legends and myths about giants, earth spirits, and guardian deities. Unfortunately, most human accounts focused on the physical impressive of trolls rather than their wisdom and nobility.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Oracle Relationships</h4>
                        <p>Some ancient human civilizations developed respectful relationships with trolls, particularly the Greeks and Romans who consulted troll oracles on matters of geology, agriculture, and long-term planning.</p>

                        <h4>The Folklore Era</h4>
                        <p>Increased human expansion into troll territories led to more frequent conflicts and misunderstandings. The period saw the rise of negative folklore portraying trolls as monsters, largely due to humans' inability to understand troll culture and customs.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Bridge Wars (847-851 CE)</h4>
                        <p>A series of conflicts arose when human engineers attempted to build bridges and roads through troll-protected territories without permission. The resolution established protocols for infrastructure development that are still respected today.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Hidden Compact</h4>
                        <p>Secret agreements between troll elders and early Sanctuary precursors established the framework for modern troll-human relations, emphasizing mutual respect and non-interference.</p>

                        <h4>Industrial Challenges</h4>
                        <p>The industrial revolution posed unprecedented challenges as mining, quarrying, and large-scale construction threatened many traditional troll territories. Adaptation required developing new forms of guardianship and protection.</p>
                        
                        <h4>World War Neutrality</h4>
                        <p>Trolls maintained strict neutrality during both World Wars, though they did protect several important sites from bombing and provided secret refuge for magical beings fleeing persecution.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sanctuary Integration</h4>
                        <p>Formal recognition by modern Sanctuary systems led to protected status for trolls and their territories. This period saw the establishment of official protocols for human-troll interaction and cooperation.</p>

                        <h4>🚨 Natural Disasters</h4>
                        <p>In case of geological emergencies (earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides), local troll guardians should be immediately notified through Sanctuary channels. Their cooperation is often essential for effective disaster response and mitigation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>⚔️ Magical Threats</h4>
                        <p>When ancient magical sites are threatened or compromised, troll guardians possess both the knowledge and power to address threats that might overwhelm conventional magical defenses.</p>
                        
                        <h4>🆘 Troll Distress</h4>
                        <p>If a troll guardian appears to be in distress or has abandoned their post unexpectedly, this indicates a severe threat that requires immediate Sanctuary investigation and possible evacuation of surrounding areas.</p>
