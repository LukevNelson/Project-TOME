                        <h3>👹 What are Ogres?</h3>
                        <p>Ogres are massive, primitive humanoids known for their incredible physical strength and violent temperament. Standing 8-12 feet tall, these ancient beings are descendants of the first earth elementals, shaped by primordial magic to be living embodiments of raw physical power and primal fury.</p>
                        <p>Unlike their smaller goblin cousins, ogres are solitary creatures who value strength above all else. They are not inherently evil, but their simple worldview and aggressive nature make them dangerous to encounter.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>💪 Physical Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>Ogres possess incredible physical mass and strength, with thick, leathery skin that provides natural armor. Their oversized hands can crush stone, and their massive frames allow them to wield tree trunks as clubs. Their thick skulls protect primitive but functional brains.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 8-12 feet tall</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 800-1,500 pounds</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Thick, leathery, often brown or green</li>
                            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> 10-20 times human strength</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 800-1,200 years</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🧠 Intelligence and Behavior</h3>
                        <p>Ogres possess simple but functional intelligence, roughly equivalent to a human child but with centuries of experience. They understand basic concepts of territory, strength hierarchy, and survival, but struggle with complex abstract thinking.</p>
                        <p>Their behavior is driven by simple desires: food, territory, and dominance. They respect strength and despise weakness, leading to constant conflicts with smaller, smarter species.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🏠 Habitat and Territory</h3>
                        <p>Ogres typically claim large territories in remote areas - mountains, deep forests, or abandoned ruins. They mark their territory aggressively and will attack any perceived intruders. Their lairs are crude but functional, often caves or simple structures built from stone and wood.</p>

                        <p>Ogres rarely form large groups, typically living in small family clans of 3-8 individuals. These clans are led by the strongest ogre, usually an elder who has proven their dominance through combat.</p>

                        <p>Ogres are extremely territorial and will fight to the death to defend their claimed lands. They mark territory with carved symbols, scattered bones, and their distinctive musky scent.</p>
                        <p>Territorial disputes between ogre clans are settled through ritualistic combat between champions, with the winner claiming the disputed land.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3>🍖 Diet and Hunting</h3>
                        <p>Ogres are omnivores with massive appetites. They hunt large game, gather wild plants, and aren't above scavenging or raiding human settlements for food. Their hunting methods are simple but effective - overwhelming force and persistence.</p>

                        <p>Ogres speak a crude form of Common mixed with their ancestral tongue. Their language consists mainly of simple concepts related to strength, territory, and survival. They communicate through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple spoken words</li>
